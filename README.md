# Simple Pagination App

- Got the data for the fake posts from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
- Made this project to figure out how pagination will work, going to implement it into some of my larger projects
- More experience with useEffect

## Axios
- Was my first time using axios
- pretty simple usage, and found it fairly easy since it did basically the equivalent of fetch in vanilla js
- using async await with the useEffect was something that I needed to refresh on
  - You can't link async with useEffect (which led to some annoying errors)
  - Instead declared a constant within, and then used async await

- Best part of making this is that I can reuse the code in any project, whenever I want to access data (fake or from a database)

## Bootstrap
- Since I did not want to spend tm time on smth small like this, I just got the main logic down and loosely styled it with bootstrap since its quick
